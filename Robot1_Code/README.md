# TODO
1. Ignore color sensor and focus on running the track with everything else *except*
color sensor.
2. Clean up constants with values that have been verified through testing.
3. Remove sortBall() or sortBalls() (whichever one works better).
4. Think/work on a solution that doesn't use color sensor.
